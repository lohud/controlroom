Lohud Traffic "Control Room"
==============

This is NOT ready for prime time yet.

App is meant to pull in traffic cameras from 511ny and allow users to view them by roadways. Additionally, app is meant to pull weather or traffic-related emergencies or data and show alerts when those exist.


Project code
==============

Project uses Zurb's Foundation as a base, with tweaks to incorporate some of Google's Material Design ideologies into the design.

What's working
==============

App itself now pulls cameras fine and is responsive.

What's NOT working
==============

~~App currently makes two separate calls and pings 511NY's api far too often. Also there's little need to constantly check for updated cameras as that rarely (if ever) changes.

To-do
==============

~~* Fix API calls instead of constant-pinging
* Create alerts for traffic/weather emergencies
* Turn off writing camera roadway json
